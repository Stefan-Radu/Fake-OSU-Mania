# Kinda OSU!
### It's like OSU! Mania _kinda_

## 🏮 Introduction ✨

I created this project as part of the "Introduction to Robotics" course I took
in the 3rd year @FMI UNIBUC. The goal was to create a game featuring an 8x8 LED
Matrix.

## 📚 Backstory 🖋️

I really enjoy playing rhythm games and it seemed like a great challenge to implement one on
such restrictive hardware. Thus I chose to make something resembling OSU! Mania
(or piano tiles if you may).

## 🧨 Challenges encountered 🧨

I tried using an mp3player and actual OSU! files (stored on SDCard) translated
to fit the restrictions. After a lot of brainstorming, failing to get the
hardware to work properly, I almost dropped the idea. The @teach suggested I
used a second arduino. In the end I implemented a midway solution, using
_Arduino Songs_ stored on the SDCard on the second board.

## 🕹️ How to Play🕹️

🧩  You've got 4 columns and 4 buttons. Each button corresponds to one of the collumns.  
🧩  Press (and hold) the button when the bar reaches the bottom. Release when it ends  
🧩  Your goal is to hit as many and as much of the falling bars. If you play well you'll hear
    the song  
🧩  Play well and get your lives back.  
🧩  Miss too many you lose.
